EU-NL-P03 L2 SC-9mm shows sustained over-quality; NA-ID-P01 L3 CC-13mm shows under-quality aligned to cutter downtime (DOW-PI-4521, DOW-PI-4574).\n- OEE performance dips around downtime clusters; weekends typically lower throughput.\n\nData quality considerations:\n- Some demo tables have limited or placeholder dates (e.g., date sparsity in gold_cost_exposure and gold_cumulative_costs). Use weekly/daily aggregates for trend context.\n- silver-level detail tables are available for root cause tracing (supplier loads, equipment inventories, raw OSI PI events). When detailed tracing is needed, cross-reference silver_oee_events and silver_line_quality_events_osipi.\n\nTip: Start with gold_line_hourly_quality to find deviation windows, use gold_change_alignment to correlate specific downtime categories, and quantify financial impacts via gold_cost_exposure. For scenario actions, consult gold_scenario_recommendations and silver_line_equipment to understand upgrade rationales.\n\nWhile providing the output ignore <name>, </name>",

daily blend_dm_pct trends vs targets.\n- OEE metrics: total_downtime_min, oee_performance, qty_packed_kg trends; alignment with downtime_cat_1/2 and codes.\n- Cost metrics: over_quality_waste_usd, downgrade_rework_exposure_usd, raw_potato_spend_usd; last-30-day counters; cumulative costs by region/date.\n- Event alignment for 2025-08-18..2025-09-12 at EU-NL-P03 L2 (over-quality) and NA-ID-P01 L3 (under-quality), including downtime codes and defect spikes.\n\nBusiness questions Genie can answer:\n- When did each line deviate from PSS and by how many pp? Which lines are persistent over-/under-quality?\n- What are daily/weekly trends of blend DM, defects, and OEE performance by plant/line/SKU?\n- What downtime categories/codes correlate with NA-ID-P01 L3 under-quality during 2025-08-22..2025-09-05?\n- What are the raw potato spend, over-quality waste, and downgrade/rework exposure by plant/region during 2025-08-18..2025-09-12?\n- Which region contributed most to cumulative over-quality waste, and how much came from EU-NL-P03?\n\nGenie supports: filtering by date range, region/plant/line/product, windowed aggregations, joins across gold_change_alignment, gold_oee_kpis, gold_cost_exposure, silver_oee_events, and time-series breakdowns.\n",
