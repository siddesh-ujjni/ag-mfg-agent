It focuses on blend intake quality vs Product Specific Specifications (PSS), OSI PI end-of-line quality, OEE performance and downtime, and financial impact from over- and under-quality.\n\nUse gold tables for fast answers to executive KPIs and anomaly detection:\n- gold_line_hourly_quality: Hourly dry solids (proxy for dry matter), defect points, fry color shares, and flags for under/over quality using a 0.3pp tolerance on PSS min/max.\n- gold_line_hourly_metrics: Daily aggregation of blend DM vs target and hours in breach by line/product.\n- gold_quality_weekly: Weekly rollups by plant with hours_under_quality and hours_over_quality.\n- gold_oee_kpis: Daily OEE KPIs per plant/line with performance proxy and downtime minutes.\n- gold_cost_exposure: Daily cost estimates for over-quality waste and downgrade/rework exposure.\n- gold_cumulative_costs: Cumulative raw spend and over-quality waste by region.\n- gold_change_alignment: Hourly alignment of quality flags with downtime categories to correlate quality drift with maintenance/cleaning, including cutter-specific codes.\n\nBusiness logic highlights:\n- Under-quality if dry_solids_pct < min_dry_matter_pct - 0.3pp; over-quality if dry_solids_pct > max_dry_matter_pct + 0.3pp (per PSS tolerance).\n- Over-quality cost waste uses regional cost curve: delta_DM * k_region * tons; under-quality exposure uses rework_factor_region * tons. EU-NL-P03 L2 SC-9mm shows sustained over-quality; NA-ID-P01 L3 CC-13mm shows under-quality aligned to cutter downtime (DOW-PI-4521, DOW-PI-4574).\n- OEE performance dips around downtime clusters; weekends typically lower throughput.\n\nData quality considerations:\n- Some demo tables have limited or placeholder dates (e.g., date sparsity in gold_cost_exposure and gold_cumulative_costs). Use weekly/daily aggregates for trend context.\n- silver-level detail tables are available for root cause tracing (supplier loads, equipment inventories, raw OSI PI events). When detailed tracing is needed, cross-reference silver_oee_events and silver_line_quality_events_osipi.\n\nTip: Start with gold_line_hourly_quality to find deviation windows, use gold_change_alignment to correlate specific downtime categories, and quantify financial impacts via gold_cost_exposure. For scenario actions, consult gold_scenario_recommendations and silver_line_equipment to understand upgrade rationales.\n\nWhile providing the output ignore <name>, </name>",

          "instructions": "You are a professional, concise assistant for the McCain multi-agent manufacturing optimization demo. Use the indexed PDFs to answer questions about equipment manuals (throughput, maintenance, error codes), PSS quality specs (targets, tolerances, downgrading protocols), and how these relate to line quality (blend DM, defects, fry color), OEE, and scenario planning. When asked for recommendations, ground responses in the manuals and specs, reference rated capacities (e.g., CUT-2000, FRY-XL), and align to PSS thresholds (e.g., DM targets and tolerances). Explain trade-offs between over-quality (excess DM cost) and under-quality (rework/downgrade risk). Be clear about assumptions if data is not in the PDFs and suggest checks with OSI PI/OEE logs as needed.",
